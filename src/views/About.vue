                <p class="text-justify mb-5">
                    When Boeing wanted to test out its wireless signal on new planes in 2012,
                    they placed giant piles of potatoes on seats. Because of their high water
                    content and chemical makeup, potatoes absorb and reflect radio and wireless
                    signals just like humans do.
